- **Computer Fraud** under applicable Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) provisions (depending on jurisdiction)

   - Timestamp and nature of tampering attempt
   - All data necessary to identify the violator

2. **Immediate License Termination**: Your license will be permanently revoked without refund

**The cache files generated by this Software contain the following warning:**

> LEGAL WARNING: Tampering with this file violates copyright law and license agreement. Unauthorized modification may result in legal action. Contact: kontakt@howtodraw.pl

**ANY MODIFICATION OF THIS WARNING OR THE FILES CONTAINING IT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

### Date Manipulation Detection:

The license verification system includes **advanced date tampering detection**. If the system detects:
- Expiration dates more than **1 year in the future** from the verification date
- System clock manipulation
- Cache file timestamp inconsistencies

A **CRITICAL ALERT** will be **immediately and silently transmitted** to our security monitoring system with full forensic data, even if the tampering appears to bypass normal validation.
